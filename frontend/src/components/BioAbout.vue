    <h6 class="item-header">About</h6>
    <p>
      &emsp;I have a passion for learning modern technologies and applying them
      to my work.
      <br />
      &emsp;Moreover, I like participating in cybersecurity competitions (CTFs)
      in my free time. This helps me to look at my code from the perspective of
      a potential attacker during programming.
      <br />
      &emsp;Also, I participate in programming contests which help me to write
      optimized code.
